# Cat and Mouse Maze
--- 
--- 

Using reinforcement learning, a cat and a mouse were placed in a maze in an attempt to teach them to each reach their targets.
The *mouse* was taught to reach the opposite end of the maze in order for it to receive its prize while the *cat* was trained to chase the mouse and eat it to prevent
the mouse from reaching its goal.
